<h2>This website was created for students of IT, students studying software programming degrees and individuals interested in learning or improving programming skills on their own via already available online resources.</h2>
<h2>Although ample online resources exist, oftentimes beginning students of computer programming can be overwhelmed as to what to study and which online resources can be relied upon for self education.</h2>
<h2>This website serves as an aid to help direct beginning or intermediate computer programming students towards the most popular and marketable languages and helps identify many reliable and proven sources of online education.<h2>
